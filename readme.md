##FitPulse-Health-Anomaly-Detection-from-Fitness-Devices

##Overview :

This project focuses on analyzing time-series health data generated from fitness watch devices such as Fitbit, Apple Watch, and other wearables.
These devices continuously record biometric data including heart rate, sleep duration, step count, and physical activity levels. 
Although this data contains valuable insights, users and healthcare professionals often overlook subtle early signs of health anomalies.
This system applies anomaly detection techniques to automatically flag unusual health patterns and supports personalized preventative healthcare.

##Objective :

The primary objective of this project is to detect anomalies in wearable health data and present diagnostic insights through a dashboard. 
The project is designed to support data-driven decision making for improving lifestyle, identifying irregular health events, and monitoring overall wellness metrics.

##Key Features :

Imports fitness tracking data from CSV and JSON files.
Cleans and preprocesses inconsistent time-series data.
Extracts statistical and trend-based time-series features.
Utilizes forecasting models and clustering methods for anomaly identification.
Detects anomalies based on threshold violations, model residuals, and outlier clusters.
Provides a dashboard for visualizing health trends and anomaly insights.
Supports file uploads, filtering by metric, and exporting reports.
